                <h2>Denver school choice is complicated. We help you make an informed choice.</h2>
                <p>DPS believes that all students should have the same access to quality schools, regardless of their background or where they live in Denver. Every DPS student is guaranteed enrollment in their neighborhood school. However, any student who wants or needs to attend a new school the following year may take part in SchoolChoice. (ECE students need to apply on a yearly basis.)</p>
                <p>Families submit one application per student, on which they rank up to five school preferences. DPS then matches students to schools based on those preferences, as well as school admission priorities and available space. The system is designed to maximize the number of students getting their most-preferred school.</p>
